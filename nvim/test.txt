I want to create neovim plugin for ease of fomatting hashes/objects/variables so that their values
are in a single column that is adjusted to longest hash_key/object element/varialbe. For me and I
guess doom developers this it more readable. Changes should be made on a selection. trigger should
be up to user, be it shortcut or command in selection :'<,'>doom!. For myself I want command.
I dont want you to write any code unless I ask, I want you to walk me throught the process of
creating that plugin. When designing plan and solution make sure to focus on performance. last thing
I want is to wait for this change to happen after pressing enter

case 1
abc: 1
abcd: 2
abcde: 3
ab: 4

case 1 result
abc:    1
abcd:   2
abcde:  3
ab:     4


case 2
abc = 1
abcd = 2
abcde = 3
ab = 4

case 2 result
abc     = 1
abcd    = 2
abcde   = 3
ab      = 4

abc = 1
abcd = 2
assrbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbcde = 3
ab = 4
abc = 1
abcd = 2
assrbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbcde = 3
ab = 4
abc = 1
abcd = 2
assrbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbcde = 3
ab = 4
abc = 1
abcd = 2
assrbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbcde = 3
ab = 4
abc = 1
abcd = 2
assrbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbcde = 3
ab = 4

abc := 1
abcd := 2
assrbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbcde := 3
ab := 4

abc => 1
abcd => 2
assrbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbcde => 3
ab => 4
